# TS utils

Typescript repository that should help me present and discuss implementation and solution of given problems and challenges on smaller scale examples. This also it helps me to not mess my github Profile with smaller projects with no incoming changes in longer run. 

The repository is based no project generated by nest-cli because for implementing and testing pure typescript functions and classes it has everything I need from the start.
[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
